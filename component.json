    "description": "<fullname>AWS Health</fullname> <p>The AWS Health API provides programmatic access to the AWS Health information that is presented in the <a href=\"https://phd.aws.amazon.com/phd/home#/\">AWS Personal Health Dashboard</a>. You can get information about events that affect your AWS resources:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>DescribeEvents</a>: Summary information about events.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeEventDetails</a>: Detailed information about one or more events.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeAffectedEntities</a>: Information about AWS resources that are affected by one or more events.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In addition, these operations provide information about event types and summary counts of events or affected entities:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>DescribeEventTypes</a>: Information about the kinds of events that AWS Health tracks.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeEventAggregates</a>: A count of the number of events that meet specified criteria.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeEntityAggregates</a>: A count of the number of affected entities that meet specified criteria.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The Health API requires a Business or Enterprise support plan from <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/\">AWS Support</a>. Calling the Health API from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise support plan causes a <code>SubscriptionRequiredException</code>. </p> <p>For authentication of requests, AWS Health uses the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html\">Signature Version 4 Signing Process</a>.</p> <p>See the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/what-is-aws-health.html\">AWS Health User Guide</a> for information about how to use the API.</p> <p> <b>Service Endpoint</b> </p> <p>The HTTP endpoint for the AWS Health API is:</p> <ul> <li> <p>https://health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com </p> </li> </ul>",
