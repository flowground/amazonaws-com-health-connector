    "description": "AWS Health The AWS Health API provides programmatic access to the AWS Health\ninformation that is presented in the AWS Personal Health Dashboard\n[https://phd.aws.amazon.com/phd/home#/]. You can get information about events\nthat affect your AWS resources:\n\n *   DescribeEvents: Summary information about events.\n   \n   \n *   DescribeEventDetails: Detailed information about one or more events.\n   \n   \n *   DescribeAffectedEntities: Information about AWS resources that are affected\n   by one or more events.\n   \n   \n\nIn addition, these operations provide information about event types and summary\ncounts of events or affected entities:\n\n *   DescribeEventTypes: Information about the kinds of events that AWS Health\n   tracks.\n   \n   \n *   DescribeEventAggregates: A count of the number of events that meet specified\n   criteria.\n   \n   \n *   DescribeEntityAggregates: A count of the number of affected entities that\n   meet specified criteria.\n   \n   \n\nThe Health API requires a Business or Enterprise support plan from AWS Support\n[http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/]. Calling the Health API from an account\nthat does not have a Business or Enterprise support plan causes a \nSubscriptionRequiredException. \n\nFor authentication of requests, AWS Health uses the Signature Version 4 Signing\nProcess [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html].\n\nSee the AWS Health User Guide\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/what-is-aws-health.html] for\ninformation about how to use the API.\n\n Service Endpoint \n\nThe HTTP endpoint for the AWS Health API is:\n\n *  https://health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
